    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients like chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, slicing paneer etc.</li>
        <li>Crush 1-inch ginger + 3 to 4 medium-sized garlic to a paste in a mortar pestle to a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside. Don't add any water while crushing ginger & garlic.</li>
        <li> After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews in a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water or as required.</li>
        <li> Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same blender add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes before blending.</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside. Don’t add any water while blending the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Heat a thick bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the flame to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons butter OR 1 tablespoon oil + 1 or 2 tbsp butter in a pan.</li>
        <li> Keep the flame to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf). Fry for 2 to 3 seconds or till the oil becomes fragrant from the aroma of the tej patta.</li>
        <li>Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready ginger-garlic paste.</li>
        <li> Fry for some seconds till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears.</li>
        <li>Pour the prepared tomato puree. Be careful while adding the puree as it may splutter.</li>
        <li>Mix it very well with the butter.</li>
        <li>Begin to cook the tomato puree on a low to medium-low flame. Stir at intervals.</li>
        <li>The tomato puree mixture will start simmering.</li>
        <li>In case the tomato puree splutters too much while cooking then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter lid (channi lid). the tomato puree might splutter if there is more water content in the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Simmer the puree for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch. You can even add ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chilli powder or ¼ to ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper or paprika or any other variety of red chilli powder.</li>
        <li>Now add the prepared cashew paste.</li>
        <li>Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low flame. Stir non-stop after adding cashew paste.</li>
        <li>Sauté till the cashew paste is cooked and again the oil will start to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will begin to cook fast. Approx 3 to 4 minutes on a low flame. So keep on stirring non-stop.</li>
        <li>Next add 1.5 cups water.</li>
        <li>Let the curry simmer and come to a boil. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger - cut in julienne (thin matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will also begin to thicken.</li>
        <li>Also add salt as per taste and ½ to 1 teaspoon sugar (optional). You can add sugar from ¼ tsp to 1 teaspoon or more depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).</li>
        <li>Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point.
        </li>
        <li>Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.</li>
        <li>Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving.</li>
    </ol>
