    <h2>What is Roti?</h2>
    <p>Roti is a simple, unleavened Indian flatbread. A version of it is found across nearly every cuisine in India. It is such a quintessential food that the very word, roti, is synonymous in Hindi with sustenance.</p>
    <p>If you are serious about learning to make rotis, it is worth buying atta flour. It will make the best and most authentic rotis and it's easily available online and in Indian stores. If you have only regular whole wheat flour you can use it but your rotis won't be as good.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole wheat atta flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make roti?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough
            <ol>
                <li>Place two cups of flour in a bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer or food procesor with the dough blade fitted. If you are new at this I recommend just using your hands until you get a better sense of how the dough should feel).
                </li>
                <li>Mix Â½ teaspoon salt into the dry flour.
                </li>
                <li>Trickle in water, a little at a time, until the dough comes together and is not sticky. Continue kneading for at least five minutes until the dough is really smooth and supple.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Rest the dough by placing the dough back in the bowl and cover with a tight lid or a damp kitchen towel. Set aside for at least 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough: You can make rotis large or small. I like mine between six to seven inches in diameter so I divide the dough into 12 balls. If you prefer smaller roti, make smaller balls of dough (you should also start smaller if you are new at rolling rotis). Keep the dough balls covered while you roll out each roti.</li>
        <li>Roll the rotis. Using a rolling pin (one without ball bearings, remember?), roll the rotis into even and fairly thin rounds. See the expert tips below for more guidance on how to do this and be sure to watch the video. I was working in an awkward position with the camera between my face and my hands so my movements are not as smooth as they should be for an experienced roti maker, but you'll get the idea.</li>
        <li>Heat the griddle. You need a flat griddle to bake the rotis (an Indian tava, which is made of very thin cast iron, or a comal, which is used for tortillas and is thicker, are both fine). Make sure the griddle is very hot but not smoking when you place the roti on it. There's no need to oil the griddle.</li>
        <li>Roast the roti: Almost as soon as you place the rolled roti on the hot griddle you should see it turning opaque. Use a wadded up napkin or cheesecloth and carefully, making sure you don't burn your fingers or use too much force, press down on the edges of the roti, moving it a little bit at the same time so it roasts evenly. If at any point the tava starts smoking too much, lower the heat. You can adjust it back up later if needed. In general a medium or medium-high heat setting should work fine once your griddle is hot.</li>
        <li>As soon as you see air bubbles form, flip the roti. Brush on some oil or some cooking spray at this point. Flip once more and continue pressing down very gently on the edges to help the roti puff up. Whether or not the roti will puff depends entirely on how evenly you rolled the roti. If you have very thin spots it won't puff up. Take heart: you will get better at this with practice, and even if the roti doesn't puff up it will still taste great.
            Flip one more time so the oiled side is up. Let the roti bake just a few seconds--you want some golden brown spots but you don't want the roti to brown all over or become stiff.</li>
        <li>Keep the roti warm and soft until serving. To do this stack the rotis and wrap them in a soft kitchen towel that absorbs any steam. Preferably eat the rotis right after making them because they are softest at this point.</li>
